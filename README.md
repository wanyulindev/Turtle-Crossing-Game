# TurtleCrossingGame
You might've played Crossy Road. This is a similar concept. We have a whole bunch of cars going across a super busy muti-lane highway, and our turtle is the player who has to cross the road.


## What I learned:
+ how to create classes (Object-Oriented Programming)
+ how to inherit classes (Inheritance Classes)
+ how to use the objects created from classes
+ knowledge of turtle coordinate system
+ knowledge of turtle game engine



###### This is what the gameplay looks like:

###### The player controls the turtle:
+ w --> going up
+ s --> going down

###### How to play this game:
> There's a whole bunch of randomly generated cars which are going horizontally across the screen. Once a player reaches the other side of the screen, the cars speed up, but the player goes back to the starting position, ready to cross the screen again. At some point, when the player turtle hits a car, then that is game over.
